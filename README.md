# Draw-The-Word-Fong-Chung-Sir é»žå¯«æ–¹ä¸­sir

This parody Mini Game is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, built with Electron. Allows users to draw the word  "sir" in traditional Chinese. This "sir" character is not a real character in Traditional Chinese. Instead, it originates from the Hong Kong movie *Love Undercover* (æ–°ç´®å¸«å¦¹) 2002. In the movie, Chung Sir creates this unique Chinese "SIR" character as an excuse for a triad boss when trying to pass himself off as the "father" of Fong Lai-Kuan, needing to explain their different surnames.

Here, you will cosplay as Chung Sir, a.k.a. Fong Chung Sir, to write the character "sir" in Traditional Chinese. You still need to try and draw the character correctly! If your score is too low, the triads will know you are an Undercover police officerðŸ‘®!

Enjoy the game in either English or Traditional Chinese!

## Technical Details

### Drawing Canvas
The drawing canvas is implemented using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element. Users can draw on the canvas using mouse or touch events. The drawing strokes are captured and stored in an array for further processing.

### Scoring Algorithm
The scoring algorithm uses TensorFlow.js to compare the user's drawing with the target character. The steps involved are:
1. **Preprocessing**: The canvas content is converted to a tensor and resized to 28x28 pixels.
2. **Normalization**: The pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].
3. **Pattern Matching**: The user's drawing is compared with the target character using image processing techniques to calculate a similarity score.

### User Interface
The user interface is built with HTML and CSS, providing a responsive and interactive experience. Key features include:
- **Color Picker**: Allows users to select the drawing color.
- **Line Width Selector**: Enables users to adjust the thickness of their drawing strokes.
- **Undo and Reset Buttons**: Provide controls to undo the last stroke or reset the entire canvas.
